                    <p>
                        Christ the King Catholic Church, Embakasi is a vibrant and growing community of faith within the Archdiocese of Nairobi. Rooted in the love of Christ and guided by the teachings of the Catholic Church, we strive to be a spiritual home where all are welcomed, nurtured, and strengthened in their journey of faith.
                        Our parish is built on the pillars of worship, service, fellowship, and evangelization.</p>
                    <p> Through the celebration of the Holy Eucharist, the Sacraments, and daily prayer, we seek to draw closer to God and inspire a deeper relationship with Christ among our parishioners.
                       <p> We are blessed with a diverse community of families, youth, children, and faithful Catholics who actively participate in parish life through numerous ministries, choirs, small Christian communities, and outreach programs. Our mission is to proclaim the Gospel, uplift the needy, and foster unity, peace, and spiritual growth within our neighborhood and beyond.
                       </p>
                       <b>You are welcome to join us as we celebrate Christ the King and build a strong, faith-filled parish family.
